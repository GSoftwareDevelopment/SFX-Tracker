# SFX-Tracker

Music Maker for ATARI 8-bit computers.

A program created using the MAD Pascal and MAD Assembler cross-compiler for the 6502 processor platform.

# RUN

To run, you will need the MAD Pascal compiler and an ATARI emulator, or real hardware and software that allows you to load the compiled program.

# CREDITS

Since I had no other choice, I had to get rid of CREDITS from the main program and find a solution where to thank all the people who participated/are participating in the creation of this program.

Here is a great place to do it, so thank you:

### FOR THE HARDWARE TESTS
## pin

### FOR SHARING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
## jhusak, mono, pin, makary, tebe, stork

### FOR INSPIRATION FOR FUNCTIONAL SOLUTIONS
## marok, mono

### FOR ALL THE PROGRAM TESTING
## marok, sun, pin,

### FOR THE MENTAL SUPPORT :)
## prix, mono, tebe, kaz, 0xF

If anyone felt unappreciated by not being on the above list, please contact me :)
